# Django-Rankingsite
#### University Ranking Site based on Django

For now, the project can only run on local host without connecting with database. 

To run the project, you should have python installed. 

Then, install Django using command: pip install Django

Inside project package, run command: python manage.py runserver [localhost:port]

By default, http://127.0.0.1:port/ranking will direct to the index page of the ranking site.
